    <p>Code Geass Gaiden: Bokoku no Akito, lit. Code Geass Side Story: The Ruined Land of Akito) 
    is an upcoming anime television series. It was officially announced in the bonus materials of Code Geass: The Miraculous Birthday. </p>
    
    <p>It will be a side story set in a.t.b. 2017 in the European warfront, where a unit made of boys and girls 
    from Area 11 is sent into a military operation with a 5% chance of survival to rescue an allied unit 
    left behind. The titular character and (presumably) main protagonist is named Akito Hyuga. 
    He has long blue hair, which is tied in a braid, and blue eyes, and is shown in promotional art 
    wielding a katana with a white hilt and square guard. The only other known character thus far 
    is a girl named Layla Malkal, who has very long, blonde hair and blue eyes. The only other information 
    concerning this series is concept art of an unusual-looking Knightmare Frame, 
    whose appearance suggests Sixth-Generation or later.  </p>
    
    <p>Kazuki Akane is directing off scripts by Shigeru Morita. As in the previous two television series, 
    Takahiro Kimura is adapting CLAMP's original character designs for animation. 
    Akira Yasuda is also returning to design the mechanical Knightmare units. 
    The anime studio Sunrise, the previous Code Geass director Goro Taniguchi, 
    and the previous series script supervisor Ichiro Okouchi are credited with the original story.</p>
