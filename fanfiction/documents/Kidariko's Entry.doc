\par 
\par Note to Readers:
\par \tab It\rquote s come to my attention  that I have never really advertised my 
FanFiction.net account. Well I do have one, except I lost that password to it so I have to recreate it. This is one of the chapters to a very long Yu-Gi-Oh fanfic. It mainly deals with some stuff going on in the first season towards the beginning of Code 
Geass. Be for warned this story is very }{\fs24\ul\insrsid5912097 crazy}{\fs24\insrsid5912097 .
\par 
\par Background to this Chapter:
\par \tab The story originally starts when Yugi Moto (Main Character of Yu-Gi-Oh! Hence his name) is kidnapped by some men who run a place called slave corporation (usually referred to as Sl
ave Corp.) While there he meets up with a young girl named Sky and her best (and only) friend Jeremy ( Who is kind of a wimp). During their escape Yugi discovers the truth about his oddball friends. Sky is a psychic and Jeremy is actually a centaur named 
Treeoby (Pronounced Tree-oh-bye) who only has two legs (so he kind of looks like a faun). When Yugi and his friends get split up, Yugi finds himself in a forest filled with mysterious mythical creatures. 
\par \tab After some time Yugi is reunited with his friends by the works of another centaur who is a doctor }{\b\fs24\insrsid5912097 and}{\fs24\insrsid5912097  Treeoby\rquote 
s grandfather named Dayon (Pronounce D-ray-on). Yugi is told a very old legend of seven guardians who could control one of the seven original elements, and that they were fighting a pair of fearsom
e creatures to stop them from taking over the world. Sky is apparently the Guardian of the Moon, and Treeoby is the Wind Guardian. He was also told he was to become the new Fire Guardian. With help from the Elvin clan Yugi was turned into a half elf so he
 could properly use the powers of the fire guardian.
\par \tab Only weeks later Seto Kaiba ( The one character that hates Yugi to his guts for reasons that no seems to be able to explain) and Joey Wheeler (Yugi\rquote s best friend) show up. Joey becomes a werewolf who controls plants (not earth\'85
just plants) while Kaiba is turned into a vampire who controls shadows. Marik (A tomb keeper who Yugi saves from his dark side Malik  during the battle city tournament) gets sick back in Egypt and Dayon finds out it\rquote s because the Wa
ter Guardian is fighting it\rquote s new host body. Luckily for everyone, Marik takes control of himself and manages to become the new Water Guardian. Leon Von Schroeder is discovered while adventuring in the movie }{\fs24\ul\insrsid5912097 
Dawn of the Dead}{\fs24\insrsid5912097  being the new Guardian of Lighting completing the group.
\par \tab Through the following months Yugi and his friends go into different stories and movies trying to fix what Tai and Tymoas (Dayon\rquote s brothers and Treeoby\rquote s great uncles) have messed up in attempts to rebuild the dark army. Some of t
he characters have received helpers also known as Controllers, this includes Marik\rquote s older sister Ishizu being the controller of ice, Joey\rquote s little sister  Serenity controller of Animals, Kaiba\rquote 
s partner Reyson who controls the element of Light, and finally Joey\rquote s pet Scrunt (the evil beast thing from Lady in the Water) Fluffy.
\par 
\par \tab The story officially begins now:
\par Yu-Gi-Oh! And the Seven Guardians--Area 11\rquote s Controller
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\insrsid5912097 Mythical Forest Almost Noon}{\fs24\insrsid5912097 
\par \tab \'93JOEY WHEELER GET YOU\rquote RE FUZZY TAILED BUTT BACK HERE!\'94 a female voice screams. Yugi sighs, for once in his life could Joey not yank on Sky\rquote 
s hair while she is doing her morning meditation? Yugi was sitting on the foot of his bed in his \rquote room\rquote  (which was basically a piece of cloth hung on a piece of rope tied to one 
branch of a tree that extended to another branch on the tree opposite of it.) reading a book. It was extremely slow that day, no patients for Dayon to help, and nothing for the Guardians to do. Everyone was getting cabin fever in their own special way. Ma
rik was standing on his head out of pure boredom, Yugi was reading any of Dayon\rquote s medical books he could find, Treeoby was scribbling nonsense onto a scrap of paper he had found, Fluffy was chasing it\rquote s tail, Joey was yanking on Sky\rquote 
s hair constantly, Leon 
was laying on his bed starring at the ceiling, Reyson was taking his time to pick off the dying feathers on his wings, Serenity was folding then unfolding blankets, Ishizu was randomly fluffing pillows, Sky was doing a extra long meditation, and Kaiba was
 chewing on his wrists.
\par \tab People were also getting snappish at each other, earlier that morning Joey snapped at Leon for accidentally stepping on his tail. Others were getting a little grumpy, even Dayon was getting grumpy. It almost noon when suddenly a sha
dow covered part of the room, looking out Yugi could barely make out the figure of a human with wings for arms. Everyone looked up and watched the figure descend from the sky, then suddenly crash into Dayon\rquote s folding table. \'93Four.\'94
 Sky muttered from where she had finally got out of meditation pose. The harpy was Treeoby ex-violin teacher, now he was the mailman. The harpy got up looking at the table \'93Sorry about the table there\'85\'94
 he remarked brushing some feathers off him. Dayon rolled his eyes
\par \'93Oh well, it\rquote ll be easy to fix. Anyway what do you want?\'94 he demanded. The harpy straightened himself and handed Dayon a letter. He bowed then left, Dayon tore the letter open skimming over the contents. He finally looked up after a while 
\'93Alright you six\'85\'94 pointing to Sky, Treeoby, Ishizu, Marik, Yugi, and Leon \'93Are going to eleven.\'94 he stated.
\par \'93Eleven?\'94 Sky raised an eyebrow
\par \'93Yes the gate is called Eleven.\'94 Dayon nodded
\par \'93Who names a gate Eleven?\'94 Leon asked Dayon shrugged.
\par \'93Hey! What about me?\'94 Joey asked pointing at himself Dayon looked over his way with a slightly annoyed face \'93You and Kabia have a meeting with the Council of Six (basically it\rquote 
s just six creatures who decided punishment for bad guys and what not) for the little fire you two started yesterday near the zombie clinic!\'94 he snapped. Serenity and Reyson exchanged looks for a moment 
\par \'93Why aren\rquote t we going?\'94 they asked at the same time
\par \'93Controllers usually aren\rquote t punished because of something the Guardians did. That\rquote s just how it works, however I might need you\rquote re help with some stuff around here.\'94 he explained.
\par \'93You need them to clean out the back room huh?\'94 Sky asked crossing her arms.
\par \'93Yes.\'94 Dayon admitted a little embarrassed
\par \'93Cause you\rquote re sacred of the raccoons that sleep in there?\'94 Sky smirked
\par \'93Shut up about that!\'94 he snapped at her looking away from her face.
\par Fluffy barked Dayon looked at him then whispered something to Reyson and Serenity
\par \'93Oooh!\'94 Serenity remarked then glance at Fluffy. Dayon waved Yugi and the others out of his house. 
\par \tab As they walked towards the portal Yugi finally asked \'93Any ideas what Dayon told Reyson and Serenity?\'94
\par \'93I think he told them that Fluffy needs a bath.\'94 Sky remarked swinging her staff over her head randomly. No one said anything else, it obvious that Fluffy hated water so it explained why he whispered to them that he needed a bath.
\par \tab \'93I think this is the gate.\'94 Sky remarked looking at the gate, it looks like one of those gate out of }{\fs24\ul\insrsid5912097 Stargate}{\fs24\insrsid5912097 . Only difference it had a door in the middle of the gate that wouldn\rquote 
t open unless you had permission from the council. Sky ran her fingers over a symbol which caused it to glow, once the light vanished, the door swung open. \'93Okay who wants to go through the creepy gate first?\'94
 Sky asked. No one replied, so Sky walked through the door first followed by Marik, Ishizu, Leon, Treeoby, and finally Yugi.
\par \tab The moment Yugi walked through he was standing in the middle of a large highway, there seemed to be no one in sight. A large flat screen TV turned on and Yugi watch as a man with blonde hair 
came out with a expression of sadness, he must have come part of the way in because the man was saying \'93And filled with sorrow and anger!....My heart is torn in two. But as viceroy of this \lquote Area 11\rquote 
 I will not give in to terrorists! People of the Empire\'85\'94 Yugi blinked. What empire? \'93Why because this is the fight for justice! And to protect everyone\rquote 
s happiness! Please join me...in mourning the eight people who died in the fight for justice.\'94 Yugi blinked again and turned away from the screen. The man had said Area 11\'85what did he mean? \'93HOLY S***! RIVALZ LOOK OUT!\'94
 Yugi looked up see a motorcycle stop a few inches away from his feet. The driver look up taking off his helmet to reveal a boy with blue hair that stuck out to the sides of his head. The other boy 
climbed out of the passenger cart taking off his helmet showing off his purple eyes and semi long black hair, he looked slightly concerned and slightly looking at Yugi like he was a weirdo \'93What are you doing standing in the middle of a highway?\'94
 the black hair asked.
\par }{\b\fs24\insrsid5912097 Meanwhile at Ashford Academy}{\fs24\insrsid5912097 
\par \tab Everyone looked about. They were standing in the middle of a large courtyard, students walked by in either full black uniforms with golden decorates on it or they walked by in a short black skirt, with a blouse wi
th a red tie on under a tan overcoat. Sky blinked \'93A private school?\'94 she asked aloud to no one in particular. Ishizu shrugged and then took a second look around
\par \'93I believe we are in Tokyo.\'94 she remarked
\par \'93I don\rquote t remember this school being here through!\'94 Marik proclaimed
\par \'93Yes but you went to Domino City. Not Tokyo.\'94 Ishizu gently reminded him
\par \'93Wait\'85why where you in Japan? I thought you were a tomb keeper?\'94 Sky questioned puzzled
\par \'93Remember? Battle City Tournament? He placed second in it.\'94 Leon pointed out
\par \'93Oh yeah.\'94
 she said after a few seconds of silence. It was a few moment later when a girl with bright orange hair walked by then stopped and look at the group. She blinked then walked over to the group and pointed a finger at Sky, Marik, Leon, and Treeoby \'93W
hy aren\rquote t you wearing you\rquote re uniforms?\'94 she demanded. Sky blinked a few times 
\par \'93Um\'85are we suppose to?\'94 she asked
\par \'93Yes.\'94 the orange haired girl simple replied
\par \'93Oh\'85.um we just uh\'85moved here.\'94 Leon explained trying to muster up a decent sounding German accent (He and his older brother are from Germany). The girl smiled
\par \'93Oh well that explains it.\'94 she held her hand out \'93I\rquote m Shirley Fenette
\par . I can help you get you\rquote re schedule if you want.\'94 Sky shook her hand 
\par \'93Nice to meet you Shirley. Hey you wouldn\rquote t happen to know where our friend is would you?\'94 Sky asked sweetly
\par }{\b\fs24\insrsid5912097 Back at the highway}{\fs24\insrsid5912097 
\par \'93So you\rquote re new here.\'94 Rivalz remarked to Yugi. Yugi and his new buddies where on the move again headed towards Ashford. The blue haired boy was Rivalz and the black haired boy was Lelouch
\par \'93Uh huh.\'94 Yugi was clinging onto Rivalz waist. There wasn\rquote t enough room for him to sit in the passenger cart so he was sitting behind Rivalz clinging on to him.
\par \'93Where did you move from?\'94 Rivalz asked just as a truck swung onto the room \'93Ah!\'94 he yelped making his bike skid to a stop}{\fs24\insrsid15228275 . The truck swerved off the highway down a ramp and
 smashed right into a building, Lelouch climbed out of the passenger seat to take a better look. As Rivalz, Yugi, and Lelouch looked down at the down from the upper road Leouch suddenly took off towards the accident scene. Yugi followed shortly \'93
Hey! Lelouch come back! We\rquote re going to be late for class soon!\'94 Rivalz called after him. Lelouch pretended not to hear him, instead climbed onto the back of the truck }{\fs24\insrsid5912097 
\par }{\fs24\insrsid15228275 \'93Hey are you alright!?\'94 he called out to the driver. No reply, Yugi climbed onto the truck as well. Lelouch suddenly froze for a moment then looked about him,
\par \'93Lelouch?\'94 Yugi asked
\par \'93Was that you I just heard?\'94 Lelouch glanced over at him slightly confused. Yugi cocked a}{\fs24\insrsid16726751 n}{\fs24\insrsid15228275  eyebrow at him
\par \'93No I didn\rquote t say anything.\'94 Yugi replied. }{\fs24\insrsid16726751 
\par \tab }{\fs24\insrsid15228275 Lelouch glanced around again before the truck suddenly came to life and pulled away from the building. This cause Lelouch and Yugi to lose balance, and fall though the open hatch of the truck\rquote s cargo area. 
 Both boys landed on their butts}{\fs24\insrsid16726751  \'93Ow.\'94 Yugi rubbed his backside, Lelouch had pulled his cell phone out}{\fs24\insrsid15228275 
\par }{\fs24\insrsid16726751 \'93Hm\'85it appears I don\rquote t get reception in the back of this truck.\'94 he mumbled. He then turned and banged on the back of the truck \'93Heey! Let us out!\'94 he called.
 No reply. After some amount of time someone appeared in the truck talking about dealing with their pursuers. Leoluch grabbed Yugi\rquote s arm and ducked behind some metal crates of some sort. Lelouch blinked twice \'93I think I\rquote 
ve seen her before.\'94 he mumbled. A friend of his perhaps? Well who ever it was disappeared from their sights.
\par }{\b\fs24\insrsid16726751 Ashford Academy}{\fs24\insrsid16726751 
\par \'93So no word on Yugi huh?\'94 Treeoby asked, he was sitting on one of the benches the school provided in one of the male Ashford Academy uniforms. Sky had the female one on trying to readjust the skirt so it was a tad longer on her
\par \'93None. No one has ever heard of someone with his description.\'94 Sky replied. Marik rubbed his temples
\par \'93Dayon is going to shoot us! We lost the fire guardian!\'94 he yelled
\par \'93Hey keep your voice down! We don\rquote t need the whole Academy knowing that!\'94 Sky hushed him. Ishizu walked over with a file in her hand
\par \'93I didn\rquote t find Yugi but\'85\'94 she opened the file and showed them the contents. It had a picture of a black spiky haired boy with green eyes sitting in some sort of lab.
\par \'93Holy crud! That\rquote s Duke Devlin!\'94 Marik gasped
\par \'93Who?\'94 Sky and Treeoby asked
\par \'93He\rquote s one of Yugi\rquote s buddies. I met him during the battle city tournament. He likes to throw dice at people.\'94 Marik explained. Leon chuckled \'93What?\'94 Marik asked
\par \'93Of all the way you could remember someone; you remember that he throws dice at people.\'94 Leon laughed.
\par }{\b\fs24\insrsid9003814 Inside of Truck}{\fs24\insrsid9003814 
\par \'93Su\'85Suzaku?\'94 Lelouch gasped. The Britannia solider gasped as well
\par \'93Lelouch? What are you doing here?\'94 he asked looking quite surprised but smiling.
\par When the truck suddenly crashed in part of the subway Yugi and Leolouch tried to get help but were suddenly attacked by and solider, which now is apparently Lelouch\rquote s friend.
\par \'93Suzaku\'85you\rquote re a Britannia solider?\'94 Lelouch asked surprised. Suzaku was about to answer when more Britannias appeared with guns. 
\par \'93Private Suzaku good work you found the terrorists! Hey how did the poison gas get open?\'94 the leader demanded. It was weird, the moment the truck crashed the funky container inside of the truck opened and out came a girl haired girl.
\par \'93Suzaku. You may now use this gun to kill the terrorists.\'94 the leader handed him a gun. Suzaku shook his head and apparently said he wouldn\rquote t. The leader shot him, the aim his gun at Lelouch and Yugi. The bullet 
hit the truck causing it to explode. Lelouch and Yugi used the smoke to run for a near by stairway, Lelouch had apparently grabbed the girl and ran with her in his arms but suddenly dropped her \'93It\'85it\rquote s all your fault! 
Suzaku is dead! Why? WHY?!\'94 he yelled.
\par \tab A bunch of guards showed up right about then surrounded the three of them. One solider shot at Lelouch but the girl suddenly jumped in front of the shot.}{\fs24\insrsid16212141  She was hit in the head, and Lelouch zoned out again. 
When he came to he looked at the soldiers \'93Why don\rquote t you kill yourselves.\'94 he ordered. A funny light shown in the soldiers eyes before all they shot themselves in the head. Lelouch clutched his hand and grinned \'93Well then!\'94 he smiled 
evilly. Yugi back away from him startled by his sudden change in mood, Lelouch looked at him for a moment before Yugi raised one hand aimed and threw a fire ball at him, Lelouch ducked it. Yugi hadn\rquote 
t been aiming at Lelouch he was aiming at the bat behind him. \'93Wha-what are you?!\'94 Lelouch asked. 
\par \'93I am Yugi Moto of Domino city, half elf and the guardian of fire.\'94 he replied letting his eyes stick out.
