<p>“Lelouch and Nunnally are dead. They were killed during the war, I’m sorry,” the Emperor told us.</p>
<p>“Dead my ass,” I yelled.</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>“Dead my ass. You sent them to Japan, knowing full well, that they would be killed. You killed them. 
So dead my ass,” I screamed.</p>
<p>“LUNA!”</p>
<p>“What! Gonna kill me now? I can do that on my own. Sorry Euphie, Cornelia, but it’s for the better,” 
I said as I shot myself in the head.</p>
<p>The last thing I saw, was Euphie and Cornelia running towards me, yelling, “NOOOOO!”</p>

<p>December 5, 2018</p>

<p>“AHHHHH,” I screamed waking up from my nightmare.</p>
<p>I’ve always had a horrible memory, but I could tell the difference between nightmare and memory.
I was an orphan, so no one knew anything about my past. In fact no one knew anything about my family 
either. All I knew was that the Ashford’s, had found me when I was about five and raised me.</p> 
<p>“What happened in there,” Lelouch yelled.</p>
<p>I stayed in the clubhouse at the school helping Lelouch take care of Nunnally.</p>
<p>“Nothing. Hey does the name Luna mean anything to you,” I asked.</p>
<p>“Um, besides the fact, that, it happens to be your name, no.”</p>
<p>“That would be the answer you would always give, Lelouch. The correct answer is the Moon, or the 
first princess of Britannia. Lelouch vi Britannia.”</p>
<p>“AHHHHHHHH! How do you know, that,” he yelled.</p>
<p>“I just said that, I’m Luna di Britannia, the first princess of Pooptannia, Zero.”</p>
<p>“AHHHHHHHHH! How do you know about Zero,” he once again yelled.</p>
<p>“Zero has geass, and you have geass. So it all adds up. Oh and I have geass. Ha-ha.”</p>
<p>“Wait, what?”
<p>“You have the power of absolute command although it only works on a person once. You have to find 
out what my geass is on your own. So if you want my help let me know, and I might help.”</p>
<p>“Um, ok then.”</p>
<p>“Oh and you’re going to need to get the black knights out quickly.”</p>
<p>“Uh, I see?”</p>
<p>“Geez you’re not even worth helping. Why did the Black Knights ever follow you?”</p>
<p>“Luna di Britannia, you are surrounded. Give up now, and you will not be killed. The Emperor, 
would like for you to come back to Britannia,” someone said from outside.</p>
<p>“Hey! How did they find me? Bye, Lelouch,” I said as I walked outside.</p>

<p>May 24, 2019</p>

<p>“I am now emperor. I killed my father. Obey me now,” Lelouch vi Britannia, the 99th emperor said.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to, Lelou.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, why won’t it work on you?”</p>
<p>“I told you before, it won’t affect me, but I might still help you. It depends.”</p>
<p>“Why so?”</p>
<p>“I’ve been locked up here, for far too long, release me and I might help.”</p>
<p>“Very well I release you from this place.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. Bye,” I said running off. No way was I staying there after that ordeal.</p>
<p>“HEY!”</p>
<p>“Today’s my birthday fool, so I’m celebrating it. OK? Good.”</p>
<p>“Um Happy Birthday.”</p>
<p>“Yeah right, Lelou, bye.”</p>
<p>I had no intention of helping him, what so ever. He had accomplished his goal, yet he continued to 
move forward. Trying to take over the world, this was too much. I knew that the black knights were 
probably in China, so I decided to help them instead.</p>

<p>May 26, 2019</p>

<p>“Whose there,” a female’s voice asked me, as I got close to the black knights.</p>
<p>“It’s me Kallen,” I said, removing my face mask.</p>
<p>“Come on in, Luna Kozuki, Luna Dewolf.” she said.</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>“So, whose side are you on, this time,” she asked as we went in.
<p>“Yours, I can help modify the Guren MK II, so it is even better, than the Lancelot. No one, 
I repeat, no one, will be able to beat it, no one. DO YOU UNDERSTAND ROCKY,” I yelled.</p>
<p>“Yes, she’s fine. She wouldn’t betray us, for all the money in the world, unless it was important.”</p>
<p>“Hai. Hey look, a monkey,” I yelled pointing to Ohgi’s head.</p>
<p>“Is that supposed to be offensive?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s supposed to be funny, because there really is a monkey, on your head,” I said laughing.</p>
<p>“Luna, come with me,” Rocky said, as she walked down a hall.</p>
<p>“Fine.”</p>
<p>“Here it is. The Guren Mk II,” she said pointing to pinkish knighmare.</p>
<p>“Wow, you’ve done a lot of work on it, Rocky.”</p>
<p>“Of course. Now, will my please, stop calling me, by that stupid nickname?”</p>
<p>“No,” I said, starting to look at the Guren.</p>
<p>“Well?”</p>
<p>“There’s not a lot I can do, without ruining the Guren,” I said sadly. “Although, I can do a little.”
<p>“Ok, I’ll help you out then. I do have one question, though. Although I trust you, no one else probably 
does. So who are you?”</p>
<p>“I am Luna Kozuki, a half blood. Yet I am Luna di Britannia, the first princess, the princess who 
shot her head and lived. The outcast. The one who wants to help change the world without violence. 
A geass user, a fighter, you get my point right?”</p>
<p>“What’s your geass?”</p>
<p>“No geass is repeated. So it is something completely different, Lelouch’s.”</p>
<p>“You can’t read minds can you?”</p>
<p>“No, that one can no longer talk.”</p>
<p>“So what is yours?”</p>
<p>“It’s embarrassing so I’d rather not tell you.”</p>
<p>“Ok then.”</p>
<p>“The filler can be ungraded, along with the weapons, which is all I will do. Although would you like 
it if I came along for repairs? You will be the most targeted person there is Kallen.”</p>
<p>“Um ok then. Go ahead,” Kallen and Rocky said.</p>
<p>“Is Nunnally here?”</p>
<p>“Yes but she won’t talk to anyone. She is too traumatized, about Lelouch that she won’t talk to 
anyone.”</p>
<p>“Then I will go talk to her. Her favorite siblings are Lelouch, Euphie, Cornelia and I.”</p>
<p>“I see. So she has yet to lose it all. Schneizel is trying to help her but is failing badly.”</p>
<p>“I see,” I said heading towards Nunnally.</p>
<p>Once I got to her room someone said, “Who is it?”</p>
<p>“It’s me Nuna, Luna. So if you wish to live Shneizel, leave. Now!”</p>
<p>“Luna, but they all said you were dead!”</p>
<p>“But I wasn’t. I never was.”</p>
<p>“Schneizel go. Luna come in,” she said as the door opened, as Schneizel left.</p>
<p>“Wow it really is you,” he said.</p>
<p>“I still bite.”</p>
<p>“Yes ma’am,” I said closing the door. “Hey Nunnally. How are you doing?”</p>
<p>“You’re the only one? Right?”</p>
<p>“No Cornelia is here also. She’s on her way up.”</p>
<p>“I see. Where going to knock some since into Lelouch. Ok?”</p>
<p>“Ok. So what are you doing here?”
<p>“I’m making the Guren better so when the war starts again, it will be war ready. When Cornelia gets 
here I will be leaving again. Sorry.”</p>
<p>“It’s alright. Is Kallen here?”</p>
<p>“Yes, she may be helping me though,” I said as the door opened.</p>
<p>“Hey Nunnally,” Cornelia said. “You’re wanted on the bridge Luna.”</p>
<p>“I no. I was saying hello to Nunnally first though.”</p>
<p>“I see. Take care.”</p>
<p>“Of course,” I said as I left.</p>

<p>June 30, 2019</p>

<p>I had just gotten the new energy filter working on the Guren. All the weapons already worked, and 
there was now room for two in the Guren MK II, one the pilot the other the mechanic. The war was 
starting.</p>
<p>“Let’s go Kallen!”</p>
<p>“Yes ma’am!”</p>
<p>“Be careful you two,” Nunnally said.
<p>“Of course you too though.”
<p>With that we took off to the sky, we instantly ran into Suzaku, but the knights of the round 
took care of him. But it didn’t do any good. They still got inside.</p>
<p>“Luna go now,” Kallen yelled.
<p>“What no! I can be of a lot of help,” I replied as Suzaku started to attack us.
<p>“No! Just go!”
<p>“Fine just come back alive,” I said jumping out of the Guren.

<p>July 4, 2019</p>

<p>Suzaku was killed, but Lelouch won, it seemed. He got the F.L.E.I.J.A. from Nunnally who could apparently 
see again and we were all going to be killed.</p>
<p>“You couldn’t kill Nunnally if you wanted too,” I said as he came by me. “You tried to do all this for 
her.”</p>
<p>“Shut up, Luna.”</p>
<p>“No go ahead, and try killing her. I dare you too. You won’t even shoot her.”</p>
<p>“Luna what are you doing,” Nunnally asked, scared.</p>
<p>“You can shoot me in the head go ahead. I’ll live through it. That’s how I got away. Someone tried to 
kill Euphie and Cornelia so I took the bullet and lived. So I shoot myself in the head knowing that the 
emperor wouldn’t give me a funeral but Euphie and Cornelia would. They traded my body with a doll that 
seemed like a real corpse, so I could escape, that’s also how I came by my geass.”</p>
<p>“What is your geass?”</p>
<p>“That’s for you to find out, Stupid.”</p>
<p>“You don’t even have geass,” he said pulling out his hand gun and aiming at Kallen, instead.</p>
<p>“See you can’t even shoot your own sister. Are you happy now, you cleared Euphie’s name so leave it at 
that and stop it.”</p>
<p>“No,” he said pulling the trigger, but the bullet never hit Kallen. “What just happened?”</p>
<p>“My geass is absolute protection. It repels all physical attacks. So executing all of us is useless, 
Lelouch.”</p>
<p>“True enough, but you’re bound to get tired at some point, right?”</p>
<p>“Not really.”</p>
<p>“But you will. Hey Zero! Took you long enough!”</p>
<p>Zero didn’t say anything. But started running. He did indeed kill Lelouch.</p>

<p>July 6, 2019</p>

<p>“Are you sure you want to do this Suzaku, Lelouch?”</p>
<p>“Yes, we are,” they said.</p>
<p>“I see. Then Nunnally will become the ruler, with Euphie and Cornelia as help. Is that what you two want?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It will be better for her.”</p>
<p>“I see. And what about C.C.?”</p>
<p>“She will be with me,” Lelouch said.</p>
<p>“I see. Are you positive this is what you want?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Luna.”</p>
<p>“Very well I wish you two both luck, with your new life. Where will you be going Lelouch?”</p>
<p>“I do not know. But I will start over.”</p>
<p>“Did you really have to make this big of a mess, just too clear Euphie’s name?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I did.”</p>
<p>“I see. Then good luck with your new lives. I will help Nunnally, Euphie, and Cornelia rebuild
Britannia and Japan.”</p>
