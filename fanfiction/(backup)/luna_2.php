$fanficContent = "<h1>Code Wolf</h1>
<p>My name is Luna, but it wasn’t always that way. I’ve had many names; first was pup or wolf pup, 
or half-breed. As I grew up I learned how to change make it look like my ears were merely a head band, 
so I was able to go to school, but I also became wanted by Britannia. I mean who wouldn’t want a 
wolf-girl? I was hiding out at one of the Royal palaces because two and a half of the royal princesses 
felt sorry for me.</p>

<p>The half was Cornelia le Britannia, she found it fun to spar with me, only because I put up a decant fight. 
The two princesses who cared for me where Nunnally vi Britannia and Euphemia le Britannia, the younger 
sister to Cornelia.</p>

<p>When Nunnally’s mother and brother found out about me they were shocked but still the let me stay. 
Teaching me to read and write and stuff. Even the Empress’s friend liked me, the one that the liked 
to call a witch, the one who gave out Geass. Yes it was C.C.</p>

<p>I woke up with a start, I hadn’t had that dream in awhile, and I was sure I probably woke up Lelouch 
and Nunnally. The Ashford’s also let me stay in the clubhouse with Lelouch and Nunnally, so I helped 
Lelouch with Nunnally.</p>

<p>As I put in a fake wire to make it look like my ears where fake, I heard a knock on the door.</p>

<p>“Who is it,” I asked.</p>

<p>“It’s me Luna, open up,” a girl’s voice said, as I opened the door.</p>

<p>“What’s up Milly,” I asked going back to putting wires around my ears.</p>

<p>“Um, that boy that was arrested for the murder of Prince Clovis is coming to our school,” she said 
in one breath.”</p>

<p>“Cool. I got a new toy.”</p>

<p>“You are to leave him alone.”</p>	
<p>“Drat, you’re mean.”</p>

<p>“We know. Well see you in a while.”</p>

<p>“Fine.”</p>

<p>When I finally got my ears wired I walked outside and ran into Lelouch, who was then dragged to class.
When we got to class we saw a Suzaku Kururugi and an angry teacher waiting for us.</p>
<p>“It’s not my fault, Lelouch was going to cut class again, but I caught him and dragged him here,” 
I said proudly.</p>

<p>“HEY!!”</p>

<p>“Yes??”</p>

<p>“Never mind.”</p>

<p>As class started everyone groaned and this is how is went for awhile. Even as Zero appeared time 
and time again, the Black Knight’s who where Zero’s army, most were scared some were not. After about 
six month’s of the military and the Black Knight’s fighting, I went to the front lines.</p>

<p>It was the battle for the Tokyo Settlement, and Nunnally had gone missing and so had Luna. What were left 
in Luna’s place were cloths, and in Nunnally’s nothing not even a picture. As I walked to the front lines, 
wearing a crimson tan top and skirt, people where wondering. This time there was no wires on my ears and 
my nails unclipped. I was probably insane, but I didn’t care.</p>

<p>I was known as Code Wolf. A girl who could turn into a wolf anytime I wanted to. I was also known as the 
money maker. There was a bigger reward on my head than on C.C.’s.</p>
<p>“C.C. what’s the status,” I asked.</p>

<p>“L.L.! So it was you staying with them,” the green haired girl said. “We have the advantage.”</p>

<p>“Lelouch is aware that Nunnally is missing right,” I asked.</p>

<p>“WHAT!!! No he isn’t.”</p>

<p>“Then keep it that way. He’ll go mad the moment he learns about it.”</p>

<p>“Ok, but what are you going to do?”</p>

<p>“Turn into what the Britannian’s fear most. A giant wolf,” I said as the ground started to tremble 
yet again.</p>

<p>In a matter of seconds, there was a giant wolf where I was once standing, I opened my muzzle and 
howled, calling my friends telling them to hurry, that there was food, and that was when the Britannian’s 
saw me.</p>

<p>“AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH GIANT WOLF,” most screamed.</p>

<p>At the moment some started to run, I laughed, which sort of sounded like a growl at the same time.</p>

<p>The remaining Britannain’s were pretty well scared. But that was the moment that Lelouch learned that 
Nunnally was kidnapped. As he went to find her the battle fell to pieces, I was even tranquilized, and 
well they tried to tranquilize me. It didn’t work too well.</p>

<p>But the battle was over as soon Zero left so what happened to Zero, C.C., Kallen, and Suzaku is still 
a mystery. Seeing as I hightailed it out of there the moment Tohdoh said go, knowing that I would be 
living in test tubes for the rest of my life. This could be five more minutes for all we knew.</p>
So that is the story behind Code Wolf. Well the story behind Luna, L.L. Code Wolf or as her friends 
referred to her as Luny Luna.</p>";
