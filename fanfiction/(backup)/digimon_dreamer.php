She is oneshot is meant to go beyond what the story could even do. 
You will read two different summaries of Geass Revelation, both containing spoilers.</p>

<p>The first is from Rika's side. The protagionist.
The second is from Higurashi's side. The antitagionist.</p>

Rika Rukaru/ Rika Kururugi's side
</p><p>

(I hold the light and the darkness of my heart,) 
</p><p>
Rika Kururugi, daughter of Zero. But to those that knew the truth, she was in fact Suzaku's daughter. He hid behind a mask as to keep a peaceful reality continuing, as he lived a death. The death he had always wanted, was more bitter than he had hoped. But he had to continue living behind that mask, let the world believe the Knight of Zero was dead. 
Only a few knew of Suzaku and they were his trusted scientists, Mr. and Ms. Lamperouge. He laughed at how it was strange that they were related to the friend he once knew. They understood what the Zero Requiem was, and understood the same as Suzaku. But, these secrets were only between them, never told to their children: Rika nor Higurashi, the Lamperouge's daughter. 
</p><p>
(Trembling while I embrace the shadows, moving me apart.)
</p><p>
Whenever Rika was to go to sleep, Suzaku would always have to tell her stories of the days he was a knight. From becoming Euphia's knight to taking on the guise of Zero and killing the Demon Emperor. But, Rika always heard the stories a different way, for Suzaku was trying to protect Lelouch's plan. He had to lie about a lot of the stories he told Rika. The plan. The plan.
But after that, to make Rika fall asleep, he would sing her a lullaby. A lullaby to show her to always fight for the future, a lullaby to help show her the way Lelouch always was about, but without ever mentioning the boy... Rika had to learn earlier that time had to continue and only those that fight for the future, will ever succeed. That is what Lelouch would have wanted. 
</p><p>
(I can't give up all the dreams that I have chased,)
</p><p>
He knew his time was coming and he planned to have Rika continue the peace. But, it was still so early... He had to stay by her side, but also had to keep her safe. On that day, he made her go to Eriol Academy in England. To keep her safe from the evil that would come. Suzaku had once heard back in C's World that Lelouch's parents had sent him away to keep him safe, but they didn't care to stay by their child's side. Suzaku would be different. He won't let Rika end up the same way that Lelouch fell. He promised to return for her.
</p><p>
(And my love will be there, and will come to me again with pride.)
</p><p>
As Suzaku made up his plan, and then faced the man that would end his life, the man that would actually kill him, Suzaku hoped that Rika wasn't already on the path of the demon. The gun was shot and his body fell. The same moment, the BiDNAHybrid, Tsubasa, awoke from its sleep with the last essence of Suzaku in it. 
</p><p>

</p><p>
(When I look to the sunset, All the colors, so beautiful)
</p><p>
Rika grew to become a strong young women. Still holding on strong thanks to that promise Suzaku gave her 10 years earlier. She had her friends: Takeru Yoko and Shinji Nadameru. Over the years Rika had become a female otaku. Though she envied the lives and adventures the teens in anime/manga had. Can't she have her own adventure?! Then came Touya Yume...
</p><p>
(That the tears fall right down, into the sea,)
</p><p>
He was just some tutor from Japan, right? He was teaching her History, she had a hard time in that subject, always saying strange things... She needed help and that is why he was made her tutor. But it changed when she began to actually like him. A teenage crush, that's all. But, this little crush is what led to the image of Touya to come off. For what lay under... was a pair of purple eyes. Ones she saw in her History book, this she knew much. And worse was those purple eyes had twin geass symbols in them.
</p><p>
(to the ocean of my heart.)
</p><p>
Rika was never meant to figure it out. But the delusion came down, in three words that would confuse Rika from that day: Touya was Lelouch. He couldn't let her get out of this freely, she was the first and last person he made a contract with. He gave her power in hopes of her helping him with the chaos that was coming of age. She agreed to it, and she put on the chains that Lelouch gave her, forever tieing her to the supposed dead boy thanks to this mental power. But what about this dormant one... What or how could this be?
</p><p>
(Though the brightness of the sun has drifted far away,)
</p><p>
Life continued on for the new geass user. But she was also living another life, as Rika, Lelouch's accomplice, the Black Knight. Then came along Higurashi. After 10 years... Rika saw her again and became the White Knight. But, one can not be the White Knight and Black Knight in this chess war. She was found out and was almost killed by Higurashi. Tsubasa protected her, for the wolf was Rika's partner though DNA. Soon later, Takeru figured it out and joined with his own BiDNAHybrid. 
</p><p>
(Tomorrow holds the sunlight of a brand new day for me,)
</p><p>
Many things happened at once. Shinji betrayed Rika and captured her for Higurashi. Higurashi used her Lamperouge genes to reconfigure Zero, once thought to be just an alter ego, into a separate person and made him her White Bishop. Kagami, a mysterious girl, became the new White Knight. This led to a full out battle, physically and mentally, between the Black Knight, Rika, and the White Knight, Kagami. But no one would guess the outcome of what was to come. 
</p><p>
(A brand new day for me.)
</p><p>
Kagami said it without any feeling of remorse, the twinge of fate hitting Rika hard. Those few, unemotional words that came out of the enemy's mouth changed her view of life forever. 
\"Rika, you, are actually the reincarnation of Lelouch's long dead brother, Rolo Lamperouge!\"
Those days of sitting along with Shinji, talking about how she didn't belong in this dimension finally made sense. With a flick of a sword, and the glow red of an eye, Rika killed Kagami the next moment. She then preceded to lick the blood off the sword. She finally realized that blood was her element. 
</p><p>
(I hold the light and the darkness of my heart,)
</p><p>
Rika held fast to this realization, but it didn't come without a price. She knew that the moment Lelouch struck her. She knew that when Shinji tried to shoot her. She knew that when Noctis insistently, pushed her to a mental breakdown. She knew that when she saw Suzaku again.  
</p><p>
(Trembling while I embrace the shadows, moving me apart.)
</p><p>
He was all along inside Tsubasa's mind. Her father was by her side this whole time. Life had given him another chance to stay by her! He slayed Noctis, and comforted Rika. He accepted her, even going as far as to say that he knew it all along. He knew that she was Rolo, but still Suzaku loved the girl as his daughter. Why else would he have even done this?! She hugged him for the last time as his soul designated. 
</p><p>
(And I can't give up all the dreams that I have chased,)
</p><p>
There was no longer a reason to cry, a reason to suffer. She needed to look towards the future even if her friends continued to look at the past. Higurashi was making her move and had already gone too far. She had already saw Zero as a traitor and executed him, returning him back to the alter ego he was always meant to be. She started to bomb Europe with newly high teched Flayia. Her plan was already coming to fruition. Rika made the hardest decision of her life... history had to repeat itself. Rika was Suzaku's daughter, Higurashi was Lelouch's niece. 
Rika would have to kill her best friend. She had to bring peace. History had to repeat. Hopefully, they would learn it this time.
</p><p>
(And my love will be there and will come to me again.)
</p><p>
Rika knew from the start that her adventure would turn out worse than the teens of anime/manga. But never did she think it would end like this! Having been rejected by Lelouch as an accomplice, Rika could only use her geass to end the war. Lelouch would no longer help her finish what had been started. 
She faced Higurashi with a malicious look. Rika's geass had already spread to both eyes and had become permanent, like the geass Higurashi had all these years too. Geass vs. Geass. 
Rika already saw the outcome of the battle... 
One nor both could live, they both sinned, they both killed, they both were mistakes in this world. 
Mistakes needed to be erased.  
With one last glow of her geass, Rika killed Higurashi and then the geass back flashed and killed Rika. It was meant to be since she agreed to become Lelouch's accomplice. But now he hated her, or so she thought. He was there as she died, crying...
Now, as her eyes closed, Rika hoped with the last of her will, that this time, people would learn. 
History couldn't be repeated again...
Rika died as she heard Suzaku's lullaby...
</p><p>
(With each rising sun, I'll find the future that is mine.)

Higurashi Su Britannia/ Higurashi Lamperouge's side
</p><p>

(In the quietly withering castle) (Sato naga yurushira ii)
</p><p>
Space and Time. They are forever fighting, opposites that hate one another. Though her eyes, Higurashi discovered that even such powerful forces, could be reborn in human souls. 
She was Space incarnate, and her former best friend, the younger girl she had in her childhood, Rika, was Time incarnate. Neither knew of their fate when they were living a wonderful, fantasy like childhood. 
That was, till the shot was fired. Zero was assassinated, Rika was gone, and her parents were also murdered. Her life was over, done, nothing to live for now...
That was till, the man clad in a black robe came to her. And he gave her power. 
</p><p>
(In a thirsty time of change) (Kuwaii takumu katari)
</p><p>
Higurashi Lamperouge died on the day her parents were murdered. And on that same day, Higurashi Su Britannia was born. Never in her life did she think her parents were hiding the fact that she was the last descendant to the Britannian Royal family. 
They were weak, her parents. They let themselves get killed, Higurashi wouldn't be like that. 
She knew what she had to do... It was as simple as what she said the moment she got her geass...
\"I will revive Britannia.\"
</p><p>
(An ash colored me is just vanishing slowly) (Ariru watashi wa)
</p><p>
She would become a demon... 
Nothing will kill her, she would become a demon. 
She will no longer be a human, she would become a demon! 
Higurashi played these thoughts over and over in her head. As she grew older, this goal only grew stronger. She worked on her parent's experiments, she rebuilt the BiDNAHybrids and even got herself one, a dragon machine named Yuki. 
She made herself the Britannian Empress at the age 17. But, every Empress needed a knight to protect her...
</p><p>
(Need to die) (Tada chito kiete ii kun no... mite ita)
</p><p>
She was now Rika Rukaru. No longer the Kururugi she once knew. But, it was Rika. And Higurashi cried. Rika was made her White Knight. Higurashi couldn't be any happier. Her best friend, was still alive after ten years! And best friends never betray each other.
Never....
</p><p>
(Gather the stars and building a castle of sand) (Hoshii wo Atsumete Tsukuru Suna no oshiro ni)
</p><p>
But, that was the day Higurashi discovered what the fate of those that are the incarnation of Space and Time get. Her best friend, Rika, she was on the other side of the chess board. She was on the Black King's side. The Demon Emperor, Lelouch. And that broke Higurashi's fragile heart more than any of the deaths she had done to others over the years. 
Rika was her enemy, and she needed to die. Higurashi failed to kill her then... but the time would come. Time doesn't heal wounds, it take lives away. 
Rika was already dead to her.
</p><p>
(Where I utter a soft prayer) (Watashi no sense)
</p><p>
She called on her brain to help her. Her ability to delusion people, with her geass and her mind. She was very smart, her smarts rivaled that of her grandfather (twice removed), Lelouch, himself.
And she discovered, the reason Lelouch was even alive. He was dead for 52 years, why was he back from the dead now?! From getting Shinji onto her side, Higurashi found out everything that the Black Side was hiding. 
Lelouch had a corrupted code, it was the only thing keeping his corpse alive. And from Shinji, she discovered Rika's identity too. Just in time to tell the new White Knight, just incase Kagami would have to use it for mental torture when she fought Rika. It came just in time too...
</p><p>
(Ambushed by those footsteps falling into dust,) (Yaganii noi ri Kumorete ochiru Sono ashin no komo)
</p><p>
Those few words that were spoken by Kagami, hit hard in Rika's view of the world. Higurashi wondered if that meant, Rika was hers... 
No, Rika snapped and slashed Kagami to bits. Many body parts, that's all that was left of the Knight...
Higurashi's other servant, Zero, who was changed into a real human thanks to Higurashi's genes of having been a Lamperouge, was soon found of having helped Rika in her plight against Kagami and Higurashi herself. His head was slashed clear off with the same sword that ended Kagami's life. Higurashi was alone now, realizing that everyone that would join her was just lying to her.  
It was time to take fate in her own hands.
</p><p>
(flowing away) (Matsui bun sete)
</p><p>
Things never do go as planned... Higurashi realized that when Rika was staring into her eyes, the geass blazing red. 
\"Death do us part.\" 
</p><p>
Higurashi looked back on what she had mounted too and smiled. It was a good try... But in the end, History was repeated. 
As her eyes closed, she knew where she had gone wrong. That was getting on Time's bad side...
Time does not heal wounds, it take lives. 
And now, it took Higurashi's.</p>
