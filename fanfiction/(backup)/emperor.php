$fanficContent = "<p>There was a deserted area, a barren wasteland filled with nothingness and the sadness of the souls 
left behind. A little girl was crawling on the ground, crawling to survive. She was wearing only the 
bare minimal, a brown shirt, with no pants, and barefoot. There were scratches all over her body, 
indicating that she went through much abuse.</p> 

<p>The poor girl was no more than ten years old, yet dying at this very moment. She was so tired and 
hungry that she did not even have the energy to walk. She just escaped from her brutal master, 
who mistreated her all the time. She always blames her powerless birth, for those who are born 
slaves will live as slaves.</p> 

<p>Suddenly, the girl with lime-colored hair woke up sweating heavily and panting for breath. It was 
just a dream, a nightmare of the past. The event took place several years ago, yet it felt like it 
happened yesterday. CC was born a slave, and has been mistreated by her masters.</p> 
<p>She got out of bed and went to the restroom to refresh herself. As she stared into the mirror, 
she took a good look at herself. So this is me, now. She is in the present, but will always remember 
her past.</p> 

<p>CC remembers the ghastly images of those who were her masters. There was man, the lord of the 
house, and his wife, the bitch who mistreated her. They both mistreated her in their own ways. 
O what cruel fate, for a mere child to live in such a household. She remembers the sound of the whip. 
*Whack!* The younger CC whimpered and crawled to the corner of the room as her master beat her. *Whack* 
“Please stop!” *Whack* “Aaah!”</p>
<p>The man continued to whip her mercilessly. “That’ll teach you to waste water! How dare you spill the 
bowl of water.”</p>
<p>CC looked at the bowl, now cracked, and the spilt water on the floor. “I’m sorry!” she yelled. 
“It won’t happen again! I promise!</p>
<p>But it was no use, she was talking to deaf ears. The man continued to whip her non-stop. 
Suddenly, the door barged open and a young man came in - he was dressed in uniform - the uniform of 
an imperial soldier of Britain.</p> 
<p>“Who the hell are you?” shouted the master.</p>
<p>“I am Ezekiel, an imperial guard of the king. You are hereby under arrest under suspicion of murder and theft.”
</p>
<p>“That is preposterous!” responded the master.</p>
<p>The soldier glanced at the girl. “Run now, quickly. Get to safety.”</p>
<p>The master was bewildered; he grabbed a sword from the wall. “How dare you…”</p>
<p>“Go now!” shouted the soldier as he drew his sword and clashed with the master.</p>
<p>CC ran out of the room and out of the house as fast as she could. When she turned around, the house 
was set on fire. This was her home, her haven, and her hell. And now she has nothing…and she has been 
walking alone…and never turned back since.</p>
<p>CC was done washing herself, and proceeded to leave the house. The second she left her doorstep, a 
man greeted her. It was her friend, Ned, one of the villages. He is a farmer, so he wears a straw hat, 
a ragged shirt, and pants with rolled up sleeves.</p>
<p>“Hey CC! Good morning to ya!”</p>
<p>“Oh, good morning Ned.”</p>
<p>“You look as lovely as ever, CC. You are a beautiful maiden!” he said with a wide smile.</p>
<p>“Of course. I know.” she replied nonchalantly. Now, most girls her age would be blushing and gaping 
at such a big compliment, but not CC. For she has heard this compliment from Ned every morning. As a 
matter of fact, that is all he says to her.</p>
<p>If one looks closely at Ned’s eyes, they can see red circles around the eyeball, which would indicate 
the influence of the geass.</p>
<p>As CC walked down the street, two little kids handed her flowers. “This is for you, Mistress CC, 
the most beautiful lady in the village.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. That’s very sweet of you.” said CC. Most would be flattered at such a compliment from 
these young ones, but CC has heard this every morning. These children also show the redness in the eyes, which means they are under the influence of the geass. 
</p><p>CC’s geass is always on, as that is how it works. As long as it is on, anyone who makes eye contact with her will immediately be infatuated with her, and thinks she is the most beautiful lady of all time, despite how she actually looks. 
</p><p>As CC walked through the town, everyone came to pay attention to her. Women are complimenting her on her looks, the children are infatuated with her, and the men are in love with her. As a matter of fact, CC receives marriage proposals everyday. It is almost to the point where it is sickening how much attention they give her. But, Geass gives the user it’s greatest desire…and in this case, it is the desire for attention…perhaps it is something she lacked during her childhood. 
</p><p>Indeed, everyone in the town is enamored with her…except for one person…the nun in the church. Those who are immortal and bear the symbol of Geass on their body are immune to Geass. 
</p><p>CC walked into the holy church, and it is empty on this particular afternoon. The nun was there, saying a prayer to the lord.
</p><p>Ironically, out of everyone in the town, the nun was the only person who CC respects, for she is the one immune to her geass. The nun turned around and greeted her. “Hi CC.”
</p><p>“Hi, Miss Dorothy.” she replied.
</p><p>Her name is Dorothy and no one knows her last name, nor do they know if Dorothy is her real name. She has been a nun for an eternity, wandering from place to place, until she found her home, which is this town. At least in this town, the people are too infatuated by CC to even notice that she is immortal. 
</p><p>“Come now.” said the nun, going to another room. “We must get you cleansed. 
</p><p>Dorothy brought back tub to the altar. CC began to strip down and proceeded to step into the tub. 
</p><p>There was a question that CC wanted to ask Dorothy for a long time, and today she decided that it is the appropriate moment to ask. “What exactly is geass?”
</p><p>“I knew you’d ask one day.” replied the nun. “It has been a long time since I had that power…once I became immortal I lost my geass…but somehow I was able to pass it on to others.”
</p><p>“Like what you did to me?” CC asked as she scrubbing her arm. 
</p><p>“Yes. I received my powers from one of the holy priests of the land…they were the very first people to have geass that I know of. I was told that geass is the power of kings…it will isolate the user.”
</p><p>“The power of kings…” CC repeated.
</p><p>“You too will need to find someone who is Geass-worthy, CC.” 
</p><p>“I don’t know what you mean, Miss Dorothy.”
</p><p>“Just as I have passed the power onto you, you shall pass it on to someone one day…”
</p><p>“What do you mean?” CC asked, getting out of the tub. “I do not know how to do what you speak of.”
</p><p>“It is simple CC…in order to be immortal…you have to kill me.” said Dorothy.</p>
<p>“What?” CC said, a bit surprised.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry you were fooled!” said Dorothy in a delirious state. </p><p>“Huh?!”</p>
<p>The only thing CC remembered was the blood that was soaked on her chest, and the look on the face of her dying friend. “Now you are cursed with immortality…my chapter is now over…and your chapter begins…I am sorry…that I used you…so that I can die on this day.” 
</p><p>Those were the nun’s last words before she passed away. CC had reluctantly stabbed her, and now she is regretful. A remorseful look came upon her face, and CC, once again, does not know what fate has brought her. Dorothy was her only friend after she was freed from slavery…but now…she had nobody. 
</p><p>That was the single most tragic night in CC’s life. Life was hard as a slave, but she never experienced such sadness and despair before…as well as regret and guilt. Dorothy had lied to her this whole time. Not lie, but withheld the truth so she can use CC to kill her when her geass matured. 
</p><p>But what can one do in her situation but move on? She must move on even if she is alone without anybody. 
<p>So now, she is immortal, huh? There are no noticeable differences except there being a geass symbol on her forehead. Also, the villagers are no longer under the influence of her geass. They no longer are infatuated with her presence. 
</p>
<p>Now, CC just wanders the town, and people no longer pay attention to her like they used to. She walked back to her home on her usual path. The men no longer were infatuated with her presence; the women were no longer jealous of her. The two little children did not giver her flowers; they just went about their own business, playing in the garden. 
</p><p>And it is for the better that the villagers did not approach her, for she is in no mood to be approached by anybody. CC walked down the path in a state of confusion and disarray, and her anger and remorse were deep like daggers in her heart. 
</p><p>She walked by Ned, and today, he did not give her the same compliment he did everyday. She just walked by him and he merely nodded as a greeting. CC did not even glance at him, she just went straight to her house. 
</p>	
<p>Little did CC know that during her moment of great despair would come her brightest ray of hope…in the form of a surprise. 
</p>
<p>The very next day, royal guards entered the village. The villagers did not get visitors often, so obviously they were surprised by the presence of strangers in uniforms. There were ten of them, all armed with swords and dressed like soldiers. 
</p><p>Their leader was a young man with blue eyes and silver hair. There He did not look vicious or intimidating at all, but rather there was a calming look about him. His eyes were bright and beautiful, but deep, so deep that one cannot fathom what kind of person he truly is. 
</p><p>The village townsfolk grew cautious. Some went back into their homes, while the others went to see what the commotion was about. 
</p><p>“What brings you here to our village, sir?” asked the village representative, who was an old man.
</p><p>“We are the royal guards of Britain.” said the man with silver hair. “We are here on King Henry’s orders to do a routine inspection of your village. We want to see that you are not harboring a rebellion or hiding any fugitives.”
</p><p>“A routine inspection?” repeated the old man. “That is preposterous. Our village is a prosperous one. We have done no such thing.”
</p><p>At this point, CC, always being the curious one, came to the crowd to check things out. 
</p><p>The man with silver hair continued to speak. “We are not accusing you townsfolk of anything. We intend to carry our orders regardless of how you feel. I suggest you cooperate.”
</p><p>CC recognized him immediately, and she ran out of the crowd to greet him. “It’s you…you were the man who saved my life…”
</p><p>Everybody grew curious. The man in silver hair also remembered CC. “Ah, it is you, the young girl from that day.”
</p><p>“You remembered me. My name is CC. I never got to thank you.”
</p><p>“My name is Ezekiel, a royal knight of King Henry.”
</p><p>“It is nice to meet you at last, Knight Ezekiel.” said CC, bowing. She turned around to face the villagers. “It is alright…he is a good person. We can trust him.”
</p><p>The townsfolk were confused. Why is she defending this royal guard? They looked to their representative. He replied, “Very well then. We shall let you inspect our homes. But after that, we are not obligated to do anymore.”
</p><p>“I expect nothing more from you.” Ezekiel replied. 
</p><p>“It was nice of you to talk the villagers into cooperating with us.” Ezekiel commented. He and CC were sitting alone on a grass field, staring at the sky. 
</p><p>“I merely told them the truth, Ezekiel.” she replied, looking at him. “So…it’s been four years since that day, huh?”
</p><p>“Indeed it has. Time sure flies.” said Ezekiel. “Back then I was just a regular knight. But today my reputation spreads amongst the populace. I have killed so many people…all for the sake of my reputation.”
</p><p>“I have heard…you are the best knight of the king, correct?”
</p><p>“I once fought ten soldiers and killed them all…by myself. They say I could take an army by myself, an army of one. They call me the Knight of One. It is not an official title, but a nickname only.”
</p><p>“You have quite the reputation.”</p>
<p>“It is thanks to the king, he has many enemies. And me, being his bodyguard, I have to protect him.”</p>
