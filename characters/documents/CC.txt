A girl who looks like she is 16 or so, with long green hair. She has been called a witch because it seems impossible to kill her. She is the one of the two who offers the contracts in which someone will get geass or something else. 

She was an orphan and a slave and not wanted. She was taken in by a nun with the ‘code’ who gave C.C. her geass, the power to be loved. But she took the nuns life gaining the code for herself, which she did not want.
She gave Lelouch his geass, as she took a bullet to the head, and Lelouch thought he would die. They both live. C.C. starts to use Lelouch’s credit card to by pizza from Pizza hut, she is called Pizza-kun by Lelouch and Kallen.
Her goal in life is to die. She hates her life so she wants to die. That is the exchange for geass.Loyal to anyone who might give her, her wish, that is a geass user, so she sticks by Lelouch until the end. She is still alive at the end. 

She knew both of Lelouch’s parents and gave his mother Marinna her geass. She was originally going to help Charles, Marinna, and V.V. make the world a less violent place by killing the Gods, but drops out of it and lives.She is last seen talking to a driver in a horse drawn carriage.
