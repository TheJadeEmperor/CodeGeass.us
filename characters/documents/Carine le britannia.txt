Carine is the Fifth Princess of the Holy Britannian Empire. She is the same age as Nunnally but the complete opposite, as in she likes war and violence. She dislikes Nunnally for her kindness, even though Odysseus tells her to be friends with her. She also becomes a maid when Lelouch becomes Emperor.
