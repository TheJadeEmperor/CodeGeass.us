Sensibility 

Vocals: Hitomi

Jibun rashisa o   kanjite iru ka
Kisei gainen   torawaretenai ka
Zeni ka akui ka   uso ka honto ka
Nani o kijun ni erabu no ka

Mitasarenai   munashisa daite
Kono basho ja nai   dokoka e yukitai
Dare mo arukanai   kono michi wa donna da
Kiri no mukou ni hizashi wa aru no ka

Hikari to yami   sono aida de   tachisukumu

Kagirinai yoake o   kurikaesu sora wa
Kibou to hakai o itsumo miteta
Bokura wa bokura no   jidai o ikinuki
Ashita e   tsunagu dake

Kizutsuku no wa   kizutsuketa hou de
Kachi ka make ka wa   kotae to wa chigau
Nagedasu mae ni   mou ichido kurai
Risuku shouchi de kake o tsuzukeyou

Ten to daichi   ikitsuku saki   dochira darou

Hateshinai aosa ga   tsuzuiteru sora wa
Kodoku to mirai no iro ga mazaru
Kokoro ni hirogaru   itami o furikiri
Tsugi e to   susumu dake

Kagirinai yoake o   kurikaesu sora wa
Kibou to hakai o itsumo miteta
Bokura wa bokura no   jidai o ikinuki
Ashita e   tsunagu dake

Hateshinai aosa ga   tsuzuiteru sora wa
Kodoku to mirai no iro ga mazaru
Kokoro ni hirogaru   itami o furikiri
Tsugi e to   susumu dake


english translation

Do you feel like yourself?
Aren’t you caught up by stereotypes?
Goodwill or malice? Lies or truth?
What will you choose to be the standard?

Embracing an unfilled emptiness
I want to go to an elsewhere that is not this place
What is this road that no one walks on like?
Does sunshine exist on the other side of the fog?

In the space between light and darkness, I stand still

The sky with the repeating, endless dawns
Was always watching hope and destruction
We’ll survive our era
And only connect to tomorrow

The ones who will be hurt are those who have hurt others
And neither victory nor defeat is the answer
Before I throw out myself, let’s keep betting
One more time, while being aware of the risk

I wonder where I will reach ahead of this, heaven or earth?

In the sky where the boundless blueness continues
The colors of loneliness and the future mix together
I shake off the pain spreading in my heart
And only advance toward the next one

The sky with the repeating, endless dawns
Was always watching hope and destruction
We’ll survive our era
And only connect to tomorrow

In the sky where the boundless blueness continues
The colors of loneliness and the future mix together
I shake off the pain spreading in my heart
And only advance toward the next one
