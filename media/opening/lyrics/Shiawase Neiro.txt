English Translation
Happiness tone

I’ll try gathering up the pieces of happiness that I picked up some other time in my chest
A melody that I started to forget about is right in the middle of me, unfading

While I was searching through borrowed comic books, from time to time I found faded anthologies
It was me who laughed out loud like an idiot at stuff like “seize the world”
During the days when I seized not the world but the hanging strap on the train
While smiling and saying, “I’m sorry,” to me back then, you lowered your head

Thank you, from my heart
I owe it to everyone for now to exist in me
Thank you, from my heart
Next it’ll be me who delivers happiness to everyone, Wow

I won’t forget just about everything since me back then was also me
It was useless that I didn’t always say ‘I love you’
When it’s tough, it’s okay even if you run away, if you return here again
Let’s go make various stops on the way in the original days

Right in the middle of an unstopping city, since when have you been looking down?
You hold too many “feelings” and blow out like a tire all alone
So listen to my words, for you who gave me happiness
I’ll give you strength day by day

I’ll try connecting the pieces of happiness that seem to overflow in my chest
A message makes the strengthening melody repeat
On a long night when my tears seem to spill, I suddenly turn back
And follow my footprints, so that I won’t forget about that day
