Saki ga mienai asu ga yomenai
Kunou no yokogao
Kotae sagashite kokoro karashite
Yowasa mo kakushite

Sotto naite mo ii yo
Tsuyogaru masuku hazushite
Futari dake no yoru wa uketomeru kara
Hitori ja nai

Kokoro de dakishimete iru yo
Kimi o tsutsumu tsubasa o hirogeteru
Ii toki mo sou de nai toki de mo
Soba ni iru
Subete ga kimi ni tsumetakute
Kurai yoru wa owari ga nai you de
Sore de mo hajimari wa okiru kara zutto miteru yo

Wakariaetari butsukaru toki mo
Sasaete iru kara
Yakusokusuru yo shinjite ii yo
Deai wa hitsuzen

Sotto namida no tsubu o
Yasashiku nugutte kureta
Kimi no bukiyou na yubi atatakai kara
Hitori ja nai

Kinou no yume o oikoshite
Kimi ga dokoka de tachidomatta nara
Me o tojite kanjite watashi o
Soba ni iru
Futari ga betsubetsu no michi o
Itsuka aruite yuku kisetsu kite mo
Hanareta hoshizora o tsunaideru kaze ni naru kara

Sotto naite mo ii yo
Tsuyogaru masuku hazushite
Futari dake no yoru wa uketomeru kara
Hitori ja nai

Kokoro de dakishimete iru yo
Kimi o tsutsumu tsubasa o hirogeteru
Ii toki mo sou de nai toki de mo
Soba ni iru
Subete ga kimi ni tsumetakute
Kurai yoru wa owari ga nai you de
Sore de mo hajimari wa okiru kara zutto miteru yo

english translation

You can’t see ahead, you can’t read tomorrow
Your face from the side looks distressed
Searching for the answer, your heart is withering
You hide your weakness, too

It’s okay even if you cry softly
Remove your mask of bravado
Because on a night with only the two of us, I’ll accept you
You’re not alone

I’m embracing you with my heart
Spreading my wings that envelop you
Even when the times are good, even when it’s not so
I’m by your side
Everything is cold to you
And the dark night seems to be endless
Nevertheless, because the beginning will take place, I’m always watching you

Because even when we’re able to understand or oppose each other
I’m supporting you
I’ll promise you, you may believe in me
Our encounter was inevitable

You softly and tenderly
Wiped away my teardrops
Because your clumsy fingers are warm
I’m not alone

If you would overtake yesterday’s dream
And stand still somewhere
Then close your eyes and feel me
I’m by your side
Because even if the season when the two of us
Will be walking on separate paths comes someday
I’ll become the wind connecting the remote starry sky

It’s okay even if you cry softly
Remove your mask of bravado
Because on a night with only the two of us, I’ll accept you
You’re not alone

I’m embracing you with my heart
Spreading my wings that envelop you
Even when the times are good, even when it’s not so
I’m by your side
Everything is cold to you
And the dark night seems to be endless
Nevertheless, because the beginning will take place, I’m always watching you
