Asa mo yoru mo koi kogarete   hoshi ni naru yo   kimi mamoru   tatakai wa yukue shirazu
Ashita to kinou no kousaten de   majiwaranai   kimi to boku   ima iku yo boku wa nagareboshi

Sekai ga kuchihatete mo   kawaru koto no nai mono ga aru
Namida o koraete de mo   mamoru beki mono ga bokura ni wa aru
Nanmannen nanokunen mae kara no messeeji ga tainai de uzukidasu   narihibiku
Shagareta koe de   asu o yobu   kizu darake no te de   kimi mamoru
I continue to fight   I continue to fight

Mitsumeai   te to te o kasanete   garasu goshi no kimi to boku   konna ni mo soba ni iru no ni
Kurai yami o masshiro ni someru yo   deguchi no nai   kimi no moto e   sadame o kirisaku nagareboshi
Afureru kimi no namida   boku ga ima ubaisaru

Kotae no nai tatakai no hate ni te ni shita no wa nana-iro no sekai?
Shirazu shirazu usurete yuku hajime no memorii mo ima ya doko ni
Dou utsuru no? Kimi no me kara mitara   ore no sugata dekiru nara mou ichido kimi to
Ano hi chikatta sora no shita de aeta nara
I continue to fight   I continue to fight

Mitsumeai   te to te o kasanete   garasu goshi no kimi to boku   konna ni mo soba ni iru no ni
Kurai yami o masshiro ni someru yo   deguchi no nai   kimi no moto e   sadame o kirisaku nagareboshi

Are mo, kore mo, subete, te ni ireru made, kuchihateru made tachitsuzukeru
Mizukara tonae, daichi ni tsudoe, hikari o yami e to tokihanate
Tachimukau kokoro ni yowane wa iranai
Zange o kiku hodo yasashii enjeru wa inai
I continue to fight   I continue to fight

Asa mo yoru mo koi kogarete   hoshi ni naru yo   kimi mamoru   tatakai wa yukue shirazu
Ashita to kinou no kousaten de   majiwaranai   kimi to boku   sadame o kirisaku nagareboshi

Hakanaku kiete naku naru koto sae   kowakunai



English translation

During mornings and nights, too, I yearn for love and I’ll become a star to protect you, without knowing the whereabouts of the battle
At the intersection of tomorrow and yesterday, you and I don’t come across each other; now I’ll go, I’m a shooting star

Even if the world rots away, there are things that won’t change
Even if we hold back our tears, things that we must protect exist inside of us
The message from hundreds of millions of years ago starts to ache inside of my body; it echoes
With a hoarse voice, I call upon tomorrow; with hands covered in wounds, I’ll protect you
I continue to fight, I continue to fight

You and I stare at each other and hold our hands together over the glass, even though I’m by your side when it’s like this
I’ll dye the murky darkness pure white; a shooting star that slashes apart fate heads to you, where there are no exits
Now I’ll take away your overflowing tears

Is what I gained at the end of an answerless battle a rainbow-colored world?
Unknowingly, unknowingly, where is my fading first memory now?
How does it reflect? If I looked through your eyes, if I could do it again with you
If we could meet under the sky that we vowed to back then
I continue to fight, I continue to fight

You and I stare at each other and hold our hands together over the glass, even though I’m by your side when it’s like this
I’ll dye the murky darkness pure white; a shooting star that slashes apart fate heads to you, where there are no exits

That, this, until I get everything, until I rot away, I’ll keep standing
Chant on my own, assemble on the earth, release light into the darkness
A confronting heart doesn’t need muted sounds
There’s no angel who is kind enough to listen to repentances
I continue to fight, I continue to fight

During mornings and nights, too, I yearn for love and I’ll become a star to protect you, without knowing the whereabouts of the battle
At the intersection of tomorrow and yesterday, you and I don’t come across each other; we’re shooting stars that slash apart fate

I don’t even fear vanishing and becoming gone rapidly
