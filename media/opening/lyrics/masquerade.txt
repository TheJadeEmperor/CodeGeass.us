Masquerade

Kokoro ni kagi o kaketa mama
Tsumetai taido de kamen o mi ni tsukeru
Dare ga boku no sugao
Shitte iru darou? Kimi no hoka ni wa

Jibun no yowasa mo tsuyosa mo
Sarakedashitai nante ichido mo omowazu ni
Namida kakushite kita
Hontou no kao o miserareru hito

Sagashitsuzuketeta kimi o ushinaenai

You’re My Destiny
Shinjite mitai
Eien no imi wa mada wakaranai kedo
You’re My Destiny
Ashita no yume o
Tsuzureba sore ga unmei ni kawaru
Say you’ll share with me one love

Kono te ni tsukamitoru tame ni
Heiki de kizutsukete koko made ikite kita
Dakedo kodoku dake ga
Kono boku no te ni nokosareta mono

Nani mo nozomanai kimi ga soba ni ireba

You’re My Destiny
Kokoro o akete
Uchiaketai yuzurenai omoi o
You’re My Destiny
Kanjiru kizuna
Futari no deai unmei nanda to
Say you’ll share with me one love

You’re My Destiny
Shinjite mitai…
You’re My Destiny
Ashita no yume o…

You’re My Destiny
Kokoro o akete
Uchiaketai yuzurenai omoi o
You’re My Destiny
Kanjiru kizuna
Futari no deai unmei nanda to
Say you’ll share with me one love



With my heart locked away
I don a cold demeanor and a mask
Who knows
My honest face? Aside from you

Having never once thought that
I wanted to expose my weakness or my strength
I have hid my tears
From someone who can show me her true face

I can't lose you when I kept on searching for you

You're my destiny
I want to try believing in you
Though I still don't know the meaning of eternity
You're my destiny
If I compose
Tomorrow's dream, it will turn into destiny
Say you'll share with me one love

In order to grasp things with my own hands
I've lived up 'til now by calmly hurting others
But what's been left behind
In these hands of mine is nothing but solitude

I won't wish for anything, as long as you're with me

You're my destiny
I want to open my heart
To the love that I can't surrender
You're my destiny
The bonds I feel
Tell me our meeting was destiny
Say you'll share with me one love

You're my destiny
I want to try believing in you...
You're my destiny
If I compose tomorrow's dream...

You're my destiny
I want to open my heart
To the love that I can't surrender
You're my destiny
The bonds I feel
Tell me our meeting was destiny
Say you'll share with me one love
