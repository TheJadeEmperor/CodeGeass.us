World End

Vocals: FLOW

Sekai no owari de   umareta hikari   ima   kaze no naka

Kireigoto dake ja ikirenai
Yasashisa dake ja iyasenai

Ubawareta no wa nan da?
Kawaranai sekai de
Kikoete kita no wa nan da?
Shikisai no uta

Everything is bright

Kudakechitta yume o   asu no hate ni   hibikaseru you ni
Sekai no owari de   umareta hikari   bokura hitotsu ni   ima   kaze no naka

Taningoto mitai ni waraenai
Samishisa dake ja nuguenai

Kachitotta mono wa nan da?
Arasoi no hate ni
Kikoete kita no wa nan da?
Kanashiki sakebi

Everything is crying

Kudakechitta yume o   asu no hate ni   hibikaseru you ni
Sekai no owari de   umareta hikari   bokura hitotsu ni   ima   kaze no naka

Dare mo nakasenaide   kaere   mitasu kokoro ni   mou nani mo kamo koete

Everything is bright

Ano hi mita sora o   negai no saki e   todokaseru you ni
Sekai no hajimari   souzou no asa ni   bokura masshiroi   ima   kaze ni naru


English translation

The light that was born at the world’s end is now in the wind

I can’t live just by whitewashing
I can’t heal just by kindness

What was stolen?
In an unchanging world
What did I hear?
A colorful song

Everything is bright

So to let shattered dreams echo to the edge of tomorrow
Light was born at the world’s end; we become one, now in the wind

I can’t laugh like it’s someone else’s business
I can’t wipe it away just with loneliness

What was won?
At the end of the fighting
What did I hear?
A sad shout

Everything is crying

So to let shattered dreams echo to the edge of tomorrow
Light was born at the world’s end; we become one, now in the wind

Don’t let anyone cry; return to your filled heart; overcome just about everything already

Everything is bright

So to let the sky that I saw back then reach ahead of my wishes
In the morning that creates the world’s beginning, we’re pure white, now we become the wind
