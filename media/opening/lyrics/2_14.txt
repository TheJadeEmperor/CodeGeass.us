Boku wa, Tori ni Naru. i will become a bird

Boku wa, Tori ni Naru.
Vocals: Hitomi

When I just can’t find my way
You are always there for me
When I am out of my way
You are always there for me

Like a bird in the sky
You set me free
You give me one heart
Like a star in my night
You’ll always be a part of me

When I just can’t find my way
You are always there
You are always there
You are always there for me

In my darkness dreams
I hear you call me
You give me the reason to live
In my dirty heart
I hear you call me
And you reach out to carry me away

No one can save my soul
Only you

Like a bird in the sky
You set me free
You give me one heart
Like a star in my night
You’ll always be a part of me


Kurai tsuki   anjisuru
Sono hikari no saki de wa
Futashika na   sonzai no
Boku no yume ga   umarekawaru

Isogi   ikiru kedo
Gomen ne

Tori ga sora o   tobimawareru you ni
Boku wa jiyuu ni ima nareru n da

Boku wa jiyuu ni ima nareru n da

Tori ga sora o   tobimawareru you ni
Boku wa jiyuu ni ima nareru n da

Like a bird in the sky
You set me free
You give me one heart
Like a star in my night
You’ll always be a part of me

The dark moon hints
That ahead of its light
My dream, of an uncertain existence
Will be reborn

I live in haste
So I’m sorry

Like how birds can fly around in the sky
I can be free now

I can be free now

Like how birds can fly around in the sky
I can be free now

Like a bird in the sky
You set me free
You give me one heart
Like a star in my night
You’ll always be a part of me
