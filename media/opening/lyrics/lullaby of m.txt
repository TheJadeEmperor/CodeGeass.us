Lullaby of M

Vocals: Hitomi

Kodomo no koro utatta   komoriuta o kikasete
Shiawase na yume miru you ni to   yasashii ano koe ga

Kanashii me ni atte mo   tsurai koto ga atte mo
Subete no koto wa itsu no hi ka   kako ni kawaru kara ne

Oboetete   kono ai wa   kesshite kawaranai to
Dakishimete kureta   nukumori wa doko na no

Iron na koto shiru tabi   sabishisa fueru deshou
Sonna toki ni wa kono uta o   omoidashite hoshii

Nakanaide   aisarete   umarete kita koto o
Itsu de mo kokoro ni   wasurenai yakusoku

Oboetete   kono ai wa   kesshite kawaranai to
Dakishimete kureta   nukumori wa eien


English translation

Let me hear the lullaby that you sang when I was a child
That voice sounds tender as if I’m having a blissful dream

Because even if sad things happen, even if bitter things happen
Everything will turn into the past someday

Please remember that my love will never change
Where is the warmth that embraced me?

Every time when you learn of various things, your loneliness grows, doesn’t it?
At such a time, I’d like you to recall my song

Please don’t cry; your birth is loved
It’s a promise in my heart that I won’t ever forget

Please remember that my love will never change
The warmth that embraced me is eternity
