<?
$context[fanlist][whatis] = '<p>A fanlisting is simply an online listing of fans of a subject, such as a TV show, 
actor, or musician, that is created by an individual and open for fans from around the world to join. There are 
no costs, and the only requirements to join a fanlisting are your name and country. Fanlistings do not have 
to be large sites (although some are) - they are just a place where you can have your name listed along with 
other fans of the same subject. TheFanlistings.org is the original (but not only) web directory for fanlistings, 
dedicated to uniting fans across the globe. (Taken from TheFanlistings.org)</p>';
