But one of\r\n	them caught his eye - it was a Britannian by the name of Diethard Ried. It is very\r\n	suspicious why someone like him would like to join the Black Knights, yet it makes Lelouch\r\n	very curious.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>In their headquarters, Zero reveals to the Black Knights a whole line of Knightmare Frames,\r\n	customized and ready for their use.

She asks why Lelouch changed\r\n	his last name to Lamperouge, but kept his first name. To which he replies, CC is not even\r\n	a human name. CC answers by saying that snow is white because it has forgotten what color it\r\n	is supposed to be.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>When the Britannian army launches their full scale attack on the mountain base, the Black\r\n	Knights realize that they are surrounded, and Zero did this intentionally so they can create\r\n	a miracle out of this hopeless situation. The members begin to question Zero''s ability to\r\n	lead, and Zero, always being the convincing one, says if you can lead this team, then shoot\r\n	me. Naturally, no one is capable of leading the team like Zero can, so they accept them as\r\n	their unconditional leader.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>The Britannian army is beating the JLF forces, despite it being their own territory. They\r\n	are losing units fast, and the general of the JFL feels the pressure.

When asked if Mao has any weakness, CC says that\r\n	he can''t turn off his Geass.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>In the library, Mao hears all the thoughts of the students and freaks out. He is only comforted by\r\n	listening to CC''s voice recordings in his headphones.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Lelouch drinks tea with Nunnally. She asks why he''s been out of the house so much. He says he has an\r\n	opponent who''s hard to beat, which Nunnally thinks is rare.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Back in his room, Lelouch asks CC if he continues to use Geass, will he end up like Mao? To which CC\r\n	replies, the more you use your Geass, the more powerful it becomes. But if you cannot control your powers\r\n	you become consumed by it.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Lelouch says to her "Because Mao couldn''t fulfill his contract, so you cut him loose.

This angers Mao, and Lelouch continues to make him jealous, saying that CC belongs to him,\r\n	and he conquered parts of CC that Mao has never seen.

By using his Geass, Lelouch is determined to destroy the Holy Empire of Britannia. To avenge the death of his mother, to create a world where his sister Nunnually can live peacefully. Staring with Japan, which became the colony, Area 11, he begins with an oath aimed at the entire world. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This episode starts us off with a flashback of Rolo''s dark past. In a random street, a bunch of politicians are walking to a meeting on a rainy night. But a little kid comes by and uses his Geass, stopping time for everyone. He takes the guy''s gun and assassinates him. In his narration, Rolo states that killing for him is like brushing teeth for most people; they don''t recall how many times they''ve done it. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>He also reveals in his narration that he has no family whatsoever. Rolo was born and trained as an assassin, and that is pretty much all he can do.

After Rolo mentioning that his job is to kill him if he becomes Zero, Lelouch counts the number of seconds on the clock. He states that Rolo didn''t stop time, but rather, his perception of time. To escape the situation and gain Rolo''s trust, Lelouch says he will lure CC out for him. But he can only do that if Rolo lets him live.

He states that he is infatuated with Zero. But when Xingke states that Tianzi did not approve of this, Gao Hai responds with, "Forget the little girl." Xingke then kills Gao Hai for treason. Then he quotes, "The Crimson Sky as perished." </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the rebels are about to be executed, all of the Japanese are watching. Villetta''s team is also watching, and she notices Ohgi.

Thus, the Black Knights are spared from being beheaded, and Kallen is happy. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rolo, now psychologically damaged, must choose between his mission and his "brother." We now learn that all this is part of his intergalactic master plan, as usual. Lelouch used the Geass on David before the battle, telling him to fire if the Burai travels a certain path. \r\nOnce he does, it will put Rolo in danger, which gives Lelouch the chance to block it for his brother, pretending that he cares, in order to get Rolo on his side. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his closing narration, Lelouch states: You, who is Nunnally''s imposter, I will use you until you dry up and throw you away like a ragged cloth."</p>', '', 'Lelouch deduces the nature of Rolo''s Geass and convinces Rolo to spare him; in return, he will hand over C.C.
