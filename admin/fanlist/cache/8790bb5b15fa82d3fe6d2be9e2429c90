<p><b>Important notice:</b> the upgrade is not as simple as the previous upgrades, hence the additional instructions. <em>Do not blindly overwrite your <code>config.php</code> file!</em></p>
<p><span id="more-288"></span>
<ol>
<li> Overwrite the following files on your Enthusiast 3 main installation using the files found in the upgrade zip:
<ul>
<li> <code>enth3/show_enthversion.php</code> </li>
<li> <code>enth3/show_join.php</code> </li>
<li> <code>enth3/show_joined.php</code> </li>

<li> <code>enth3/show_owned.php</code> </li>
<li> <code>enth3/show_update.php</code> </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Open the <code>config.php</code> file found in this zip and fill in your database information. For each listing you own, you must overwrite your <code>config.php</code> file for that listing with this new configuration file. Please don&#8217;t forget to change the listing ID variable to the correct listing ID! </li>
<li> The following may be optional, depending on your setup, but highly recommended for forward compatibility and ensured security &#8212; you will need to update your code snippets to use the <acronym title="Hypertext PreProcessing">PHP</acronym> constant <code>ENTH_PATH</code> instead of the <acronym title="Hypertext PreProcessing">PHP</acronym> variable <code>$path</code>, like so:
<pre><code>&lt;?php include 'config.php';
$show_list = false;
include ENTH_PATH . 'show_joined.php'; ?&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The <code>install.txt</code> file included in the upgrade zip will contain all the new code snippets if you need to take a look. </li>
</ol>
<p>Please upgrade your Enthusiast installations as soon as possible. If you encounter issues with this upgrade, please feel free to post comments regarding the issues.</p>
<p><strong>Remember:</strong> You must also overwrite the <acronym title="configuration file for the script">config file</acronym> found in your collective. Basically, all configuration files except for the one inside your Enth3 administration panel will need to be updated.</p>
<p><strong>Remember #2:</strong> By &#8220;code snippets&#8221;, I mean all code snippets, including the collective code snippets, and the fanlisting code snippets. In that regards, it means that the <acronym title="configuration file for the script">config file</acronym> for your collective <em>and</em> each of your fanlistings will need to be updated.

<p>But I haven&#8217;t thrown in the towel just yet.</p>
<p><strong>That doesn&#8217;t mean, however, that everything will be oh-so-fine and dandy and scripts will get chugged out of this scripts archive/tech blog at a steady pace.</strong> I wish I could, but there are only 24 hours a day, and seven days a week. I am no longer a college student, as the case was when I started Enthusiast all those years ago and virtually no one knew about it.</p>
<p>(I started to break down my time in an attempt to show just how scrapped for time I am, but I decided not to let it go that far.)</p>
<p><strong>Enthusiast is not the only thing I have to put my time on.</strong> I have three blogs, and none of them even get updated as regularly as I like. My first love is creative writing, but I can&#8217;t even allot proper time for that. If you look at my fanlistings, a whole <em>chunk</em> of them haven&#8217;t even had new layouts in a year, some of them over two! I&#8217;ve even relegated to using layouts made by others in my journal (and maybe others) in an attempt to cut down on whatever coding I need to do. I&#8217;m a developer/designer, coding is what I do, but I can&#8217;t have time to whip up a quick <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> file to customize my own things. How sad is that?</p>
<p><strong>Enthusiast is not the only thing I want to do.</strong> I have three scripts I want to create, one script that <em>desperately</em> needs a revamp (and I mean <em>really desperately</em>, but guess what? Enth development is still ranked higher), and I have a couple of others (featured here) that needs an update sometime soon.

<p>That said, <strong>Enthusiast is important to me.</strong> I don&#8217;t think any one of you who are using it can claim that Enthusiast is more important to them than it is to me.

<p>(For those of you interested in it, it will probably be slow going, as whatever free time I have needs to be spent juggling between rest/recreation/social/family/other hobbies&#8230; and because I&#8217;m putting in a lot more effort in the backbone, and in usability.)</p>
<p><em>One thing I&#8217;ve always believed in is that you only get as good as what you actually do.</em> That one might read a lot of tech blogs, a lot of white papers, a lot of those hifalutin framework blueprints&#8230; but if you don&#8217;t get down and dirty with code, you can&#8217;t expect to get better. It&#8217;s a given that the first few codes you churn out will be riddled with flaws. That&#8217;s normal, but that&#8217;s better than never getting over that simply because &#8220;I can&#8217;t fully understand OOP yet, I need to read more about it&#8221;. Ugh, get a grip, and get on with playing with code.</p>
<p>My first <acronym title="Hypertext PreProcessing">PHP</acronym> project, way back when I was doing self-studying, was actually the precursor to Enthusiast. It was the script that handled my then-fanlisting, <a href="http://midnight.aking-mahal.net/">Bubblegum Crisis</a>. After it was working, I moved on to the first &#8220;system&#8221; &#8212; an admin tool for handling my directory for NeoPets galleries. I actually put up that site, got a pretty nice following for it, and then when I weaned off NeoPets, I shut it down.</p>
<p>And then I started working on Enthusiast (the single-fanlisting version).</p>
<p>Without these first projects, I&#8217;d never have learned <acronym title="Hypertext PreProcessing">PHP</acronym>. And this time, with <a href="http://www.php.net/index.php#2007-07-13-1">PHP4&#8217;s End of Life</a> looming in the distance, Enthusiast will be bringing me forward to PHP5. OOP, Exceptions, and many newfangled stuff in <acronym title="Hypertext PreProcessing">PHP</acronym> isn&#8217;t new to me, but it&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve actually handled <acronym title="Hypertext PreProcessing">PHP</acronym> code continuously (almost eight months&#8211;the same time I&#8217;ve been with Yahoo! as a frontend engineer). I will be getting personal with a lot of these new things, in order to do what I need for it to do. And that&#8217;s quite exciting.</p>

(Yes, I&#8217;ve started working on <a href="http://scripts.indisguise.org/2008/01/07/development-musings/">Enthusiast 4.0</a>.)</p>
<p>(For those of you interested in it, it will probably be slow going, as whatever free time I have needs to be spent juggling between rest/recreation/social/family/other hobbies&#8230; and because I&#8217;m putting in a lot more effort in the backbone, and in usability.)</p>
<p><em>One thing I&#8217;ve always believed in is that you only get as good as what you actually do.</em> That one might read a lot of tech blogs, a lot of white papers, a lot of those hifalutin framework blueprints&#8230; but if you don&#8217;t get down and dirty with code, you can&#8217;t expect to get better. It&#8217;s a given that the first few codes you churn out will be riddled with flaws. That&#8217;s normal, but that&#8217;s better than never getting over that simply because &#8220;I can&#8217;t fully understand OOP yet, I need to read more about it&#8221;. Ugh, get a grip, and get on with playing with code.</p>
<p>My first <acronym title="Hypertext PreProcessing">PHP</acronym> project, way back when I was doing self-studying, was actually the precursor to Enthusiast. It was the script that handled my then-fanlisting, <a href="http://midnight.aking-mahal.net/">Bubblegum Crisis</a>. After it was working, I moved on to the first &#8220;system&#8221; &#8212; an admin tool for handling my directory for NeoPets galleries. I actually put up that site, got a pretty nice following for it, and then when I weaned off NeoPets, I shut it down.</p>
<p>And then I started working on Enthusiast (the single-fanlisting version).</p>
<p>Without these first projects, I&#8217;d never have learned <acronym title="Hypertext PreProcessing">PHP</acronym>. And this time, with <a href="http://www.php.net/index.php#2007-07-13-1">PHP4&#8217;s End of Life</a> looming in the distance, Enthusiast will be bringing me forward to PHP5. OOP, Exceptions, and many newfangled stuff in <acronym title="Hypertext PreProcessing">PHP</acronym> isn&#8217;t new to me, but it&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve actually handled <acronym title="Hypertext PreProcessing">PHP</acronym> code continuously (almost eight months&#8211;the same time I&#8217;ve been with Yahoo! as a frontend engineer). I will be getting personal with a lot of these new things, in order to do what I need for it to do. And that&#8217;s quite exciting.</p>

<p>The fix? It&#8217;s rather simple. After every chunk of code (or <acronym title="Hypertext PreProcessing">PHP</acronym> include) you put in your WP template that accesses the database server (read: it generates the above error), add this line of code:</p>
<pre><code>// reconnect to WordPress database
$wpdb-&gt;select( DB_NAME );</code></pre>
<p>(Actually, the first line isn&#8217;t that important. But comments are good for you.) This might not work for every instance; basically it just changes the database that the link connection is using. However, it&#8217;s possible that the new database user the connection is, ah, using, can&#8217;t access your WordPress database. So if the above doesn&#8217;t work for you, you&#8217;ll have to use something else:</p>
<pre><code>// reconnect to WordPress database
$wpdb = new wpdb( DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_NAME, DB_HOST );</code></pre>
<p>That should basically restart the WordPress database. I haven&#8217;t tested the second option, so if you end up needing to use the second option and get problems, let me know. :)</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re using Enthusiast with WordPress 2.1.2+ and need a better example, here&#8217;s something that may be clearer:</p>
<pre><code>// show joined listings
require( 'config.php' );

<p>The full Enth download has been updated to 3.1.1, and there is also a 3.1.1 upgrade zip file which will contain only the updated files.</p>
<p>The list of changes are below:<br />
<span id="more-118"></span></p>
<ul>
<li> Fixed bug that prevents showing of owned listings with different statuses in one page due to a function declaration </li>
<li> Renamed get_category_children to get_enth_category_children function to make Enthusiast compatible with WordPress </li>
<li> Fixed bug that does not replace $$stat_totalaffiliates$$ with the proper value in listing statistics template </li>
<li> Fixed bug that prevents putting join, update, and lost password forms in one page due to function declaration </li>
<li> Fixed bug that says email sending to a certain email address failed before last-resort <acronym title="Hypertext PreProcessing">PHP</acronym> mail() mailing takes place </li>
<li> Fixed errors on parsing image URLs if on Windows servers </li>
<li> If image uploading fails, folder will be CHMODed to 755 then 777 to upload image; if CHMODed to 777, folder will be CHMODed back to 755 after uploading </li>
<li> Half-fixed bug that doesn&#8217;t show empty child categories whose children have listings in them (read: personally not happy with the fix) </li>
<li> Fix neglected listings notification bug that incorrectly states they have not been updated when a new year starts </li>
<li> Fix bug that doesn&#8217;t update the member&#8217;s &#8220;show email&#8221; setting when they try changing it using the update form </li>
<li> Fix bug that doesn&#8217;t remove underscores from the additional fields&#8217; delete record field in the update form </li>
